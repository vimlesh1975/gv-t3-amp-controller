# Grass Valley T3 iDDR Broadcast Controller (Next.js & AMP Protocol)

A professional, broadcast-grade software control surface for the **Grass Valley T3 iDDR** (and T2 / K2 media servers) built with **Next.js (JavaScript / React)** and the **Advanced Media Protocol (AMP)** over TCP port **3811**.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Channel Deck Architecture
Matches the native Grass Valley T3 iDDR 3-channel topology:
- **CH 1: R1 (Record & Playout)**: Full recording and playout with instant live clip creation.
- **CH 2: P1 (Playout 1)**: Primary program/air playout deck with loop and cue points.
- **CH 3: P2 (Playout 2)**: Secondary preview/aux playout deck.

### 2. Broadcast Transport Panel
- **Tactile Illuminated Pushbuttons** with hardware tally feedback:
  - `REC` (Bright illuminated red tally)
  - `PLAY` (Bright illuminated green tally)
  - `STOP` (Illuminated amber tally)
  - `STILL / PAUSE` (Illuminated blue tally)
  - `REW (<<)` & `FF (>>)` (Variable shuttle rewind/fast forward)
  - `LOOP` (Illuminated cyan continuous loop tally)
  - `EJECT`
- **Broadcast Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - <kbd>Space</kbd>: Play / Stop toggle
  - <kbd>K</kbd>: Stop
  - <kbd>J</kbd>: Shuttle Reverse (-2x / -4x)
  - <kbd>L</kbd>: Shuttle Forward (+2x / +4x)
  - <kbd>I</kbd>: Mark IN Point
  - <kbd>O</kbd>: Mark OUT Point

### 3. SMPTE Timecode & Precision Scrubbing
- **High-Contrast Digital SMPTE Readout**: Glowing amber/green/red 7-segment style digits (`HH:MM:SS:FF`) supporting Drop-Frame (DF) and Non-Drop-Frame (NDF) at 29.97 / 59.94 / 25 / 50 fps.
- **Secondary Markers**: Live calculation of Mark IN, Mark OUT, Clip Duration, and Countdown Remaining time.
- **Rotary Jog Wheel**: Drag with mouse or scroll with mouse wheel to perform frame-by-frame jog stepping (`-1 Frm`, `+1 Frm`).
- **Variable Shuttle Slider**: Scrub from `-16x` to `+16x` speed with optional auto-center spring return.

### 4. Real-Time Video Screen & Audio VU Meters
- **Simulated Video Monitor**: Live raster and playback bar animation, safe area guides (16:9 / 4:3), center crosshairs, format badge (`1080/59.94i HQX`, `4K ProRes 422`), loaded clip name, and glowing SMPTE timecode burn-in.
- **Dual-Channel Audio VU Meters**: Calibrated stereo scale (-48 dBFS to 0 dBFS) with green/amber/red peak clip indicators.

### 5. Clip Bin & Media Library
- List clips stored on the T3 server storage with metadata (Duration, Codec, Resolution, Date, Bin).
- Direct `Load to R1`, `Load to P1`, `Load to P2` actions.
- `New Rec` creator: Set clip name and immediately trigger recording on Channel 1.
- `Sync`: Query live clip directory from T3 (`A2140000` / `A115FF`).

### 6. Live AMP Protocol Inspector
- Terminal view showing raw hex packets exchanged in real time:
  - Direction: `TX` (Client -> T3), `RX` (T3 -> Client), `SYS` (Internal events).
  - Hex codes (`CRAT0007204Vtr1`, `CMDS00042001`, `1001 ACK`, `1111 NAK`, `722002`).
  - Human-readable parsing of every transaction.
- Raw Hex Command Sender with one-click broadcast macro buttons.

### 7. Dual Engine Mode: Real Hardware + Virtual Simulator
- **Physical Grass Valley T3 Hardware**: Connects over a real TCP socket (Node.js `net.Socket`) to port `3811` at your T3's IP address.
- **Virtual T3 iDDR Simulator**: Built-in high-fidelity deck emulation allowing immediate development, demonstration, and testing without requiring physical hardware.
